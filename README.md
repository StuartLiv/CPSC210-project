# Calorie and Macronutrient Tracker

## Project Description

This project aims to offload the calculations and tracking of food intake that is common to dieters, gym goers and 
anyone concerned about their nutrition. While nutritional information is usually on food packaging, inconvenient serving
sizes and numbers cumbersome to do mental calculations with make doing this on your own difficult. The goal of this 
application is to have users enter minimal data about the food they ate, and then using past entries and a standardized 
database of nutritional information, track the:

- Calories
- Protein
- Carbohydrates
- Fat
- Overall mass of food
- Time of meals

Users can store recipes with measured amounts of food as *frequent meals* to make entering them again easier, add 
ingredients they use to the database, see daily summary statistics about their food, compare information about different
ingredients, observe diet changes over time and more. 

As someone who currently tries to track this information, I have yet to find a method better than doing it in my head 
and only daily tracking, and not over a longer period of time, as to maintain and calculate this data on my own is far 
too time-consuming to be worth it. I believe that a major barrier to self-improvement is lack of digestible information
and a large time commitment just to get started, and with this project, I aim to make starting, and keeping to your 
nutritional goals easier.
